	Implementation
	
		1. Rewrite build from and include jQuery.Deferred objects
		2. DRY out host api/polyfill implementation
			1. Should use same message handler


  Error Handling

    1.  Cache errors, when we've reached a "boil over" - terminate
    
          After 1st error...
      
      
          5XX, slow down and listen, if errors continue
      
      
          404, kill it
      
      
    2.  Server decision?
        
          
          Fail after ten minutes of continuous failure
          
          


    3.  2 Failures, Terminate, Restart.
    
          > dev hook return true, set timeout restart; return false kill it.
    
    4.  End developer control, via custom events fired "on error"
    
    


  JSONP Support
  
    1.  stream labels to create NAMED callbacks for script tag creation
    
    
    Use Cases: dropping your "updater" functionality into any remote location
